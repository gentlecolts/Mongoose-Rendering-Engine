/*
this file is a shortcut for including the entirety of the math objects provided by this library
no code should be in this file

please note that as of this time, all structs in this library will use double precision instead of single precision
support for single precision and quadruple precision may potentially be added at a later date
this will likely be revisited when i finally get around to writing gpu code
